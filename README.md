_Web-controlled ESP32 drawing machine_

An update to [mini-draw](https://github.com/danja/mini-draw) with improved hardware and this time using an ESP32 to allow control over Wifi (from the Web, initially at least using [environs](https://github.com/danja/environs)).

## Status

**2022-01-03** This repo set up. I've got most of the hardware ready from previous experiments. Hopefully I can lift most of the inverse kinematics code from [mini-draw](https://github.com/danja/mini-draw).
